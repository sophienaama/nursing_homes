  <p class="intro">
    <p> Around 15 percent of elderly adults have mental disorders, according to the World Health Organization. But many nursing homes across the nation, including in New York, prescribe anti-psychotic medications at rates of up to 43.1 percent,
      according to federal data.</p>

    <p>An investigation by the Human Rights Watch in 2017 found that thousands of nursing home residents were being given drugs for diagnoses they did not have, often without informed consent, and that long-term care facilities were using the
      medication as a way to sedate residents who displayed difficult behaviors. </p>

    <p>Risperdal, Seroquel and sometimes Ativan, drugs usually used for treatment of schizophrenia, carry the strongest FDA warning labels because they significantly increase risks of death, according to the Human Rights Watch report. </p>

    <p>“The use of psychotropic drugs in nursing homes is a major issue,” said Barry Schechter, a long-term care borough supervisor and ombudsman at the Center for Independence of the Disabled, a nonprofit that advocates for the disabled including
      the elderly. “There are concerns that psychotropic drugs are being used inappropriately, especially on patients with dementia,” he said.</p>

    <p>In New York State, 123 of 619 facilities or almost 20 percent of facilities were prescribing antipsychotic medication to long-term care residents. Long Term Care Community Coalition (LTCCC) said that only 2 percent of the elderly population
      has a diagnosis that would require antipsychotics. Top nursing homes prescribing psychotropics in New York included facilities in New York City, Whitestone and Lake Catrine </p>

    <p>A data report by the Long Term Care Community Coalition, a nonprofit that specializes in advocating for the elderly in residential settings in New York, stated that almost 7 percent of all nursing home residents on antipsychotic drugs are in
      New York, but that citations accounting for the inappropriate use of the drugs only account for 3.7 percent. </p>

    <p>Lisa Furst, who runs the Geriatric Mental Health Alliance at Vibrant, a nonprofit that deals with mental health, said that from a state perspective, management of mental health and long-term care are often too separate. “We’d like to un-silo
      that a bit,” she said. “Broadly, the main issue that we have is that older adults are not a priority for the behavioral healthcare system in New York State.”</p>
